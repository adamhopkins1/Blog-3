                Thoughts on the March 15 93rd Oscar Nominations, March 23rd 2021
              </h3>
              <p>
                Good Morning so this is a late post but Monday after my birthday
                was the Oscar Nominations Announcement that was on ABC's Good
                Morning America David Fincher's "Mank" was the most nominated
                film for this year with 10 nominations including "Best Picture"
                including nods for Gary Oldman as the title character Herman J
                Mankiewicz,Best Director (David Fincher) and Supporting
                Actress(Amanda Seyfried), But the surprises was for me was the 6
                nominations for Florian Zellers's "The Father", Shaka King's
                "Judas and the Black Messiah" Lee Issac Chung's "Minari" , Chloe
                Zhao "Nomadland" Darius Marader "Sound of Metal" Aaron Sorkin's
                "The Trial of the Chicago 7" Emerald Fennell's "Promising Young
                Woman" which recieved 5 nods. Okay so this is interesting, I
                feel this years slate of films were outstanding and thoughoughly
                were quality experiences. In an unfortunate year where the
                impact of COVID-19 impacted the overall moviegoing experience
                each of the films mentioned managed to tell engaging, impactful,
                and fully- realized stories.It was dissapointing to not see
                films like "Nomadland" "Promising Young Woman" or "Trial Of The
                Chigago 7" in a theater such as my local "Cinemark" or "The
                Charles Theater" As I did in previous years. But overall I think
                this years class or nominees are top notch. I believe
                wholeheartedly this is Chloe Zhao's year as she has made a
                remarkable beautiful, and just excellent film "Nomadland" I
                never Thought a gifted and visionary director such as Chloe Zhao
                would be able to pull off a amazing trilogy of films such as
                "Songs My Brothers Taught Me", "The Rider" and now with
                "Nomadland" I have never been impacted heavily as this film has
                had on me. I feel this movie absolutely captures 2020 and the
                moment many movies either attempt or try to capture of dealing
                with the stages of grief and pain but the celebration of life in
                its purest like this movie has. I see this movie picking up
                awards in many categories mainly Best Picture, Best Adapted
                Screenplay, Best Cinemtography (Joshua James Richards camerawork
                is A-tier), Best Actress(Frances Mcdormand) and Best Director for Chloe Zhao whose
                three movies speak volumes of her vision and strong eye for
                telling stories.In other categories I see Best Original
                Screenplay going between Emerald Fenell or Lee Issac Chung for
                "Minari" As I know the AMPAS voting body is becoming more
                international. So it wouldn't be a surprise If they choose
                "Minari" as this movie could really capture the immigrant
                experience in a way that opposite of "Promising Young Woman",
                focus on domestic abuse and sexual assualt might have some
                semblance to the AMPAS branch but not towards the male body of
                the Screenwriting commitee.

              <h3>
                Thoughts on the Producers Guild Association Predictions, March
                24rd 2021
              </h3>
              <p>
                Tonight is the announcement of the winners for the 2021
                Producers Guild Association, which is considered a precursor and
                predictor of the Academy Award for Best Picture. It will be
                tonight many of the predictions point to Fox Searchlight's
                Nomadland to be the top pick for the PGA which I do agree will
                be the PGA Winner but I wanted to posit a thought about tonights
                ceremony just to note there are ten nominees of the ten nominees
                there are 2 nomninees that are no nominated for best picture by
                the AMPAS now this will be a very precarious position for movies
                like "Mank", "One Night in Miami","Ma Raineys Black Bottom" and
                "Borat Subsequent MovieFilm", many of these films are
                distributed by streamers such as Amazon and Netflix many which
                falls outside the perview of the academy voters. Now as someone
                not intimate with the AMPAS secret voters or the inner workings
                of the preferential ballot commitees for the AMPAS voters. But I
                would suggest the academy voters are not taking kindly to the
                current conditions of viewing streamers digitally as opposed to
                the natural enviromnment of viewing films in a commnunal
                theater setting. I can see Nomadland winning the PGA which
                would be a 5th consecutive win for Fox Searchlight. However
                there are many chances for a "Green Book" scenario there is the
                possibility that "Trial of the Chicago 7" could be the PGA
                choice and would be the first win for Netflix as a streamer to
                win the PGA but also it could be Focus Features year where
                "Promising Young Woman" will be the chosen favorite but I do see
                "Nomadland" eventually winning PGA and DGA and Ultimately Oscar.
                But again there is a possibility "Trial of the Chicago 7" could
                upset or even "Minari" could have chances of gaining foothold
                towards April 25th 2021. I do also see that in leading up to the
                25th of April there will be a final release a late entry in
                Florian Zeller's "The Father" from Sony Pictures Classics now
                headed up by Tom Rothman the former Founder of Fox Searchlight.
                There is a high chance the razor thin possibility that
                "Nomadland" and "The Father" could be neck in neck in terms of
                Academy Awards voters mindshare. It will be an interesting night
                for sure. The reason I added Sony Pictures "The Father" is due
                to the late (or long early addition) of Anthony Hopkins (Best
                Actor) Olivia Coleman(Best Supporting Actress) Correction: I
                want to add that Florian Zeller was not nominated for Best
                Director in his place is Thomas Vinterberg of the excellent film
                "Another Round" (Denmark), It has also been nominated for Best
                International Feature ("Another Round") it is peculiar to see this films recieve
                best director and this make me very curious about the choices in
                that category and would this prompt only Chloe Zhao to take Best
                Director and "The Father" to take Best Picture. I am really
                intrigued about this choice. But we will know more tonight at
                the PGA awards and On April 25th it should be an interesting
                ceremony on both fronts.-AH
